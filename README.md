# RFID-robot
self-balancing, two-wheeled robot that searches, picks up and transports RFID tags to specific landing zones

this is a project to learn about and apply various technologies:
- An Arduino to stabilize and operate a 2-wheeled, self-balancing robot
- A Raspberry Pi 4B as master controller, using a camera, an RFID-reader, a servo to control a mechanical lever, an electro-magnet and a network
- An EC2 instance on AWS to which logfiles and images are uploaded
